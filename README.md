# OS X for Front-end developers <!-- omit in toc -->

As Front-end developers ü§ì we can build basic websites with nothing more than a text editor and a browser, but we want to up our game by adding a JavaScript framework like React or Vue and useful tools like Git to our workflow.

But wait! Our Mac isn‚Äôt ready. Before diving in, we‚Äôll need to install a few items that will save we from confusing errors later. üò©

This is the minimum (IMO) setup we'll need to get up and run on our Mac and a checklist to set up our ‚ú® OS X for front-end development.

üöÄ Let‚Äôs go!

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

‚úãüèª First things first!

Keeping your system up to date is crucial. Keep an eye out for updates on the regular.

### Update Your Mac

Before installing any new software, follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/HT201541) from Apple to upgrade macOS and your current software to the latest version.

### Enable Firewall

This is for online protection when we're not in our home network or not behind a router.
```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
```

### Enable FileVault Encryption

We're most likely using a portable laptop of some kind. If we lose it, the laptop gets stolen or someone tries to hack into it, our personal data is at risk. Using full-disk encryption is an extra layer of security to keep our mind at ease in case of potential intrusion.

üöß Two main caveats:

- **Do not misplace or forget your FileVault recovery key or login password**. Losing this password means you cannot log in and without the recovery key everything on your computer is inaccessible if you can't decrypt the files during a recovery. iCloud is an option to store the Filevault password. Using iCloud, Apple Support will be able to assist you with recovering data. iCloud isn't fully encrypted so whilt it's convenient, it's less secure.
- If macOS gets corrupted and you need to download files from the drive after accessing the drive from an external case, it's not possible without the password and recovery key. Make sure you're both backing up using [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/HT201250) on an external drive or a NAS.

Follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/HT204837) from Apple to enable FileVault Encryption.

## üíª System Tweaks

Apple's default system settings are limiting and don't show a lot of information. Let's change the settings for better usability around the system.

### Unhide the Library folder

```bash
chflags nohidden ~/Library
```
    
Alternatively, open Finder, press <kbd>‚áß</kbd> <kbd>‚åò</kbd> <kbd>H</kbd> , <kbd>‚åò</kbd>  <kbd>2</kbd> , <kbd>‚åò</kbd> <kbd>J</kbd> and check *Show Library Folder*. Unhiding this folder could be useful for manual backup, but it's not necessary.

### Show Path Bar and Status Bar in Finder

```bash
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowPathbar -bool true
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowStatusBar -bool true
```

### Show Full Path in Finder Title Bar

```bash
defaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool true
```

### Prevent Time Machine from Prompting to Use New Hard Drives as Backup Volume

I don‚Äôt use Time Machine. It is better than nothing but not necessary. But keep this on if you have an external drive you use for backups.

```bash
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine DoNotOfferNewDisksForBackup -bool true
```

### Show All File Extensions

```bash
defaults write -g AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true
```
    
### Disable Creation of DS_Store Files on Network Volumes and USB Drives

```bash
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool true
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Developer Tools

The first thing we'll need to install from the command line are our Mac's **command line developer tools**. Installing these now will prevent weird errors later.

Xcode weighs something ~2GB and is useful for the iOS simulator but is not necessary unless you're developing iOS or Mac apps. Good news is Apple provides a way to install only the Command Line Tools, without Xcode.

Using Terminal, install the tools with this command:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
To check if the tools are already installed, type the following command in your terminal app and hit return:
```bash
xcode-select --version
```

There's not a straightforward way to update Xcode Command Line Tools, so we have to remove the existing tools to reinstall from scratch.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select --install
```

## üç∫ Homebrew

Instead of installing the next few tools by going to each tool's website, finding the download page, clicking the download link, unzipping the files, and manually running the installer, we‚Äôre going to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) üòç.

Homebrew is a tool that lets us install, update and uninstall software on our Mac from the command line. This is faster and safer than the manual approach and generally makes your development life easier.

Install Homebrew with:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## ‚¨õ Choose a Terminal App

Since you'll be interacting with your Mac using the command line in this article, you'll need a terminal app.

Any of the following are good options:

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is)
- Terminal (the default app that comes with our Mac's)

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Dev apps

Running either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

```

### Spotify

Spotify is a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songs.

### Zoom

*I recommend you look for an alternative to zoom* ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Zoom is the leader in modern enterprise video communications, with an easy, reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing, chat, and webinars across mobile, desktop, and room systems.

```bash
brew install --cask zoomus
```


## üóÉÔ∏è Other stuff

### Update Everything easily

Once in a while, run the following command and everything you‚Äôve installed with Homebrew will update automatically:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup && brew doctor
```

That one command is all you need to keep your system up to date. üôå I usually run it when I start a new project, but feel free to do so whenever you like.

(When you run this command, if Homebrew suggests additional commands for you to run, go ahead and run them. If a command begins with sudo and you are prompted for a password, use your Mac‚Äôs admin password.)

That‚Äôs it for the command line!

### Zsh prompt for Astronauts. ü§©

[Spaceship ZSH](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/) is a minimalistic, powerful and extremely customizable Zsh prompt. It combines everything you may need for convenient work, without unnecessary complications, like a real spaceship and I really love it.

![Spaceship prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10276208/36086434-5de52ace-0ff2-11e8-8299-c67f9ab4e9bd.gif)

#### Requirements

To work correctly, you will first need:

- [zsh](#zsh) (v5.2 or recent) must be installed.
- Powerline Font must be installed and used in your terminal (for example, switch font to [Fira Code](#font-fira-code)).

#### Installing with oh-my-zsh

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt" --depth=1
```

Symlink `spaceship.zsh-theme` to your oh-my-zsh custom themes directory:

```bash
ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme"
```

Set `ZSH_THEME="spaceship"` in your `.zshrc`.

If you are looking for an alternative  [Starship](https://starship.rs/) is one of them.

### Our privacy matters

That is why I recommend using Firefox. Especially Firefox in the version 85 [cracks down on supercookies](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/).

My list of extensions:

- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin). An efficient blocker add-on for various browsers. Fast, potent, and lean. With uBlock I am subscribed to an [adblock list](https://github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list) to block "browser-based crypto mining"
- [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://duckduckgo.com/app). DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials comes packed with best-in-class privacy essentials and makes browsing in Firefox even faster.
- [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook).  Facebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.

Another tool that I like it is [AdGuard](https://adguard.com). AdGuard is ta standalone ad blocker for Mac, Iphone, etc... No need for extra applications or browser extensions. Just download ad blocker for Mac by AdGuard and kill a small flock of birds with one stone. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Conclusion

You're all set! üéâ

That‚Äôs all our need to get up and running with JavaScript-based front-end development on our Mac.
